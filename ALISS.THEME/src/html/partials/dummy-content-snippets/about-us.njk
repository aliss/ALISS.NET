  <h2>ALISS vision</h2>
  <p>We believe that the people of Scotland living with long term conditions, disabled people and unpaid carers should be able to access the information they need to help them live well.</p>
  <p>The ALISS (A Local Information System for Scotland) Programme is funded by the Scottish Government and delivered by the Health and Social Care Alliance Scotland (the ALLIANCE).
  </p>
  <p><strong>ALISS key objectives are:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>To increase the availability of health and wellbeing information for people living with long term conditions, disabled people and unpaid carers.</li>
    <li>To support people, communities, professionals and organisations that have information to share.</li>
    <li>To ensure that stakeholders are informed, skilled and confident in the use and application of web services and that they are connected as part of a wider community of practice.</li>
    <li>To ensure that ALISS is used and is strategically aligned with Scottish health and social care needs.</li>
  </ul>
